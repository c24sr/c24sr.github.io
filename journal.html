	<p> Journal Entry #1
<br>
	The first thing I made in CS1 was my person card. I replaced all the previous tags with my own and then put in my own links. I ended up with a milk and cookies gif and then when you hover over it you get rickrolled.
<br>
I have so far I have learned how to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I decided to make a phone that when you click on it, it opens. It took me a while to understand stuff like punctuation and I made a lot of little mistakes in my code here and there. I ended up just having to play around with code and trying new things until I found what I wanted. I created a div called iPhone that was a picture of a locked iPhone and customized it in my style section. Then I made another div called iPhone2 that was a picture of an open iPhone. After that, I added an EventListener and now every time you click on the iPhone it opens and also says “hi Sachi” in the console. I also added text above that tells you to click the phone.

I think I have a pretty good understanding of everything so far except for text. I’m still a little confused about what h1 means but I will make a lab about that. I’m also a little confused about functions, but I am excited to go over that next class. I think I’m also going to continue having labs every week because they are really helpful for my understanding of Comp Sci. For the future, I would like to try making a choose your own adventure story. I am very eager to see what my future in CS1 holds and I am excited to see what I will make in the future.

	<p> Journal Entry #2
<br> I just made my first website. It is still a work in progress but I think everything is going pretty good so far. I added a function so that everytime you click somewhere on the screen it says "hi". I haven't decided if I want to keep that still or change it to something else yet. I also need to fix my About Me page because right now it isn't working. Last week I published my first project using Terminal. You can now find it if you go to my projects tab.

	<p> Journal Entry #3
<br> I am in the process of making my 2nd code sketch. It is a function and it’s going to have a bunch of avocados floating around the screen. I did have some trouble making it because I am not yet completely comfortable with functions. Once I finish, it will be linked under my projects tab.

	<p> Journal Entry #4
<br> I just finished a Thanksgiving card. It’s basically an animated turkey and when you click on it the turkey gets angry and jumps up. It’s now under my projects tab so you can go look at it there. This weekend I think I’m going to try to make my website a little better and make sure everything is cleaned up and organized.
